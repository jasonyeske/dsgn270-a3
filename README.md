## dsgn270-a3, SVG Logo Design

### Code Journal

- I want my design to be for a hockey gambling website
    - User needs to know its hockey related by looking at it

- Hockey sticks and a puck are the most known things about hockey
-  Add some text so people know the brand too from the logo
- Have the sticks crossed for a cool looking design
    - add a puck between the sticks

### Problems I Encountered
- ViewBox not appearing
    - Fixed by scrolling down in SVGOMG
- Not being good at anything art related (thats a me problem)
